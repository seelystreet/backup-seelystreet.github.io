      <description>We are so proud of our house and we believe it dates back at least to 1902 and the Rev Joseph Smith of the Church of England. We understand that either the Rev Smith or the Church built several houses on Seely Street. Based on records from Saint John City Library we have been able to compile the following list of previous owners of our wonderful B&amp;amp;B.
December 2006 â€“ to present Garth &amp;amp; Helena Millar moved from England and converted the house to a Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast graded to a 3.</description>

      <description>The Deer View Room
Many times we have watched the deer in our rear gardens from this room as they wander between the houses on their way from Rockwood Park. This large bedroom room in the middle of the house offers a Private Bathroom and a walk-in closet with a Queen Sleigh Bed. There is a large dresser and mirror and a great old fireplace. We think of this room as one in which to relax and unwind.</description>

      <description>The Seely Suite
Tucked away at the rear of our house is our Private Suite with bedroom with Queen Bed, separate sitting room and en-suite bathroom. This is a great room for long stays as you have the comfort of a living area as well as privacy due to its location in the house. We have a Sofa Bed in this room so that we can accommodate a family of 4 or 4 adults in 2 double beds.</description>
